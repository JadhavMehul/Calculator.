# Calculator.
Simple calculator in IDLE Python.
In this reprosetry you will find all about calculators whose syntx are written in IDLE Python.
Calculator to add, subtract, divide, multiply, etc. you can also find a calculator to find area and many more.
My main motive to create this reprosetry is to provide source code of my project to every one for free of cost.
Basically it is opensource.
