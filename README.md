# Calculator.
Simple calculator in IDLE Python.
In this repository you will find all about calculators whose syntax are written in IDLE Python.
Calculator to add, subtract, divide, multiply, etc. you can also find a calculator to find area and many more.
My main motive to create this repository is to provide source code of my project to every one for free of cost.
Basically it is opensource.
